## [Evolving Random Systems](https://github.com/JFJStephenson/MonteCarloSim/blob/main/FindingPiWithMonteCarlo.ipynb)
This project is an brief investigation into randomised sampling, and how by employing Monte-Carlo techniques, you can be used to make predictions and estimations that would otherwise be extremely computationally expensive.
