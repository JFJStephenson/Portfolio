## [Evolving Random Systems](https://github.com/JFJStephenson/MonteCarloSim/blob/main/FindingPiWithMonteCarlo.ipynb)
This project is a brief investigation into randomised sampling, and how by employing Monte-Carlo techniques, you can make predictions and estimations that would otherwise be extremely computationally expensive. 

To summarise:

- Calculate Pi via randomised co-ordinate sampling, exploring the relationship between accuracy and sample size.
- Simulate self-assembly of particles suspended in space with inter-particle attractive forces via the principle of energy minimisation.
- Move particles in random directions and include a randomised chance to accept some energetically unfavourable particle positions in order to prevent the simulation from getting stuck in local minima.
- Use NumPy, Pandas and Object Orientated MatplotLib to produce readable, efficient code and quality figures.
